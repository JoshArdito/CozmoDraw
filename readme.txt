TODO LIST

Rachel Nakamura:

1.) Build pen attachment that is reliable.
  ie: not too much friction when Cozmo lowers lift, but enough
  to make a steady line.


Joshua Ardito:

1.) Process images with OpenCV with parameters that produce long straight
    lines easily drawn by Cozmo.


MVP Goals:

- Have Cozmo draw the line

Stretch Goals:

- Have Cozmo extract the image from one seen in front of him
    - draw on paper with thick border, so contour easily detectable
    - draw with thick lines (probably using a marker)
    - crop and rectify image

- Have Cozmo move to his canvas from arbitrary location
  (providing he can see it). Maybe we can use an aruco-tag or just
  contour detection.
